1a. Starting with an eScriptorium-generated text:
	Paste the plain text into an .xml file in Oxygen.
	Annotate the text to reflect the original edition's <head>, <milestone>, <p> or <l>, and, if applicable, <lg>.
	Save result as XXXXorig.xml (substituting the file's name for XXXX, here and below).	
	Using Oxygen, apply the xml-to-txt.xsl transformation.
	Save the result as XXXX.txt

1b. Starting with a found plain text in verse:
	In a folder that contains line_tagger.py, save the file as XXXX.txt 
		(substituting the file's name for XXXX, here and below).	
	On Windows, navigate to that folder in terminal/command,
	Then run:
	> python line_tagger.py XXXX 1 (or replace '1' with the text's first line number)
	The file XXXXorig.xml should result.

1c. Starting with an already created TEI .xml file:
	Open it in Oxygen.
	Apply the strip-most-tei.xsl transformation.
	Save result as XXXXorig.xml (substituting the file's name for XXXX, here and below).	
	Using Oxygen, apply the xml-to-txt.xsl transformation.
	Save the result as XXXX.txt


2. Tag the plain text:
	Copy XXXX.txt and XXXXorig.xml into the RNNTagger folder.
	Add pos.xml.py an replace_tokens.py to that folder, if you haven't already.

	On Windows, navigate to RNNTagger folder in terminal/command,
	Then run:
	> cmd/rnn-tagger-middle-high-german.bat XXXX.txt
	Open a new text file and paste in the results of RNNTagger's operation.
	"Save as" with the name XXXXtag.txt, ***with utf-8 encoding***.
	Then run:
	> python pos-xml.py XXXXtag
    	That should generate a new file, called XXXXtag.xml

3. Recombine the tagged text with the original xml:
	Run: 
	> python replace_tokens.py XXXXorig.xml XXXXtag.xml XXXXfinal.xml
